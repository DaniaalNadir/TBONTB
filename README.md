Use this in conjunction with the task scheduler and run it daily or weekly, take your pick.
When you are setting up your trigger, in the advanced settings check the "Repeat task every" and set it to hour and "for the duration" of a day. Also check the "Stop all running tasks at end of repetition duration".
Then on your action tab, browse the .exe file which is "\System\System\bin\Release/system.exe".
Then click ok and there you go, the best prank to use on your friends or whoever.
